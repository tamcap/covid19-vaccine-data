# COVID-19 vaccine historical data set

Data has been collected from the official websites presenting COVID-19 vaccine progress.

* [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations) is updated every day. If update falls on a federal holiday, nobody knows just yet what will happen.
* [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention LTC](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations-ltc) is updated as above. First data point is 2021-01-21.
* [NC Department of Health and Human Services](https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/vaccinations) is updated every Tuesday, and other days if they feel like it.

No warranties are made as to the accuracy of this data. Ultimately, I am just just a stranger on the Internet - this data should not be used to inform clinical or public health practice without verification via secondary sources.
